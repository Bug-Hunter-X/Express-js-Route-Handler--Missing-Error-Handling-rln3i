# Express.js Route Handler: Missing Error Handling
This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: insufficient error handling in route handlers.  The `bug.js` file showcases a route that lacks proper handling for database errors and cases where a user is not found. This can result in unexpected server errors or exposing sensitive information.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with comprehensive error handling.

## Bug
The primary issue lies in the `/users/:id` route.  It fetches a user from a database but does not properly handle errors from the database operation or the case where a user with the given ID doesn't exist. This leads to cryptic error messages or unexpected behavior for the user.

## Solution
The solution includes explicit checks for errors returned by the database interaction and specific responses for different error scenarios (database error, user not found). This approach provides a more robust and user-friendly experience.
